Application made as a final project in my undergraduate study of computer science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in Osijek.

Application parses alarms contained in txt files and separating its categories. It then generates HTML code based on those categories and renders it in the form of an HTML static web page, alongside with filters and context hyperlink

Project includes:
1) application.py - main script for parsing the text files and generating HTML code
2) alarms.html - generated HTML file (web page containing the alarms)
3) alarms1.txt, alarms2.txt ... - text files containing alarms
4) Word document containing instructions for the project in Croatian language

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Open the project in an IDE of your choice (VSC or PyCharm works best)
2) Make sure you are running Python 3.9.7. or newer
3) Open application.py
4) If needed, add more alarm text files and include them in the array at line 155.
5) Run the script. Your newly rendered HTML file should be in the folder ready for use.
